<br>In my personal life, I have a deep passion for music, which I believe can express emotions too subtle for words. I often attend concerts and live performances, and I also enjoy singing pop songs myself. For me, singing is a wonderful way to relieve the stress that sometimes comes with research. Although I tend to be introverted, I once stepped out of my comfort zone to perform a solo rendition of Beyond’s classic song (海阔天空) at my graduate farewell party (as shown above).

## Workshop

<br>There must be something truly magical about standing on stage to give a fantastic speech, which considerably lifts my spirits and energizes my entire body. If you desire to master a specific knowledge in depth, just give a prelection. If you can explain to others for complete understanding, you are already an expert. I really enjoy the accomplishment of imparting my knowledge to others, so what I strive for is to be **a student's favorite professor** at the [best universities in my hometown].

I previously enjoyed long-distance running, [vlog making](https://space.bilibili.com/594030035), and computer game developing/playing. However, I have no time to do any of these things recently.
