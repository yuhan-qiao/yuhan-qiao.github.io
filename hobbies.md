## Hobbies

#### Reading, Writing Blogs & Meditation

I enjoy reading beyond my academic field, keeping reading notes, and writing blog posts. I have a broad interest in **history**, **psychology**, and traditional Chinese **philosophy**. Through reading, I seek a better understanding of my inner self — how my emotions work and how to live in harmony with my own mind.

I truly enjoy the process of reading; it often brings me a sense of calm, peace, and quiet joy. I’m also interested in Buddhist and Zen philosophy, and I often practice meditation as a way to clear my mind and release stress. I like to write down my reflections and share my thoughts on my personal blog. If my writings can inspire or help others in any way, that makes me genuinely happy.

You’re welcome to follow my **WeChat public account**: **_CowboyJohnny_**, where my blog posts are first released. The posts will also soon be synchronized and updated in the [**_Blogs_**](https://yuhan-qiao.github.io/blogs/) section of this website.

#### Singing & Concert

<br>In addition, I have a deep passion for music, which I believe can express emotions too subtle for words. I often attend concerts and live performances, and I also enjoy singing pop songs myself. For me, singing is a wonderful way to relieve the stress that sometimes comes with research. Although I tend to be introverted, I once stepped out of my comfort zone to perform a solo rendition of Beyond’s classic song (海阔天空) at my graduate farewell party.<br>
