### About Me

<img src="https://yuhan-qiao.github.io/qyh6.jpg" class="floatpic">
Here is Yuhan Qiao (John, 乔禹涵).<br>

I received my Master's degree in _Computer Science & Technology_ from [Beijing JiaoTong University](https://www.bjtu.edu.cn/) in 2024, supervised by [Prof. Caiyan Jia](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/8097/). Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in _Infomation Engineering_ from [China University of Mining & Technology (Beijing)](https://www.cumtb.edu.cn/). 

My previous research focused on **graph representation learning** with an emphasis on improving model generalization and robustness through **self-supervised** and **semi-supervised learning** approaches. Specifically, I explored applying these methods to the task of **rumor (misinformation) detection**, where labled rumor data is often scarce. 

Currently, I am taking a gap year to further prepare for my Ph.D. studies, and I am actively seeking a position where I can continue advancing my academic career. I aspire to pursue my doctoral studies abroad to broaden my academic horizons, collaborate with outstanding researchers, and unlock my full research potential. Toward this goal, I have dedicated significant effort to improving my English proficiency. Over the past year after graduation, I studied intensively for the _TOEFL_ exam, eventually achieving a score of 106 (Reading 30, Listening 26, Speaking 23, Writing 27).

Honestly, I consider myself a reliable and steady person with strong perseverance and a never-give-up attitude. I am always open to learning new knowledge and believe in continuous lifelong learning. I hope to find a Ph.D. supervisor whose research interests align with mine and whose personality is compatible.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions. Feel free to contact me at **yuhan.qiao.bjtu@gmail.com**
