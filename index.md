#### Yuhan Qiao

Here is Yuhan Qiao (John, 乔禹涵). I received my Master's degree in Computer Science & Technology from Beijing JiaoTong University in 2024, supervised by [Prof. Caiyan Jia](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/8097/). Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Infomation Engineering from China University of Mining & Technology (Beijing). 

My previous research focused on **graph representation learning** with an emphasis on improving model generalization and robustness through **self-supervised** and **semi-supervised learning** approaches. Specifically, I explored applying these methods to the task of **rumor (misinformation) detection**, where labled data is often scarce. To address this challenge, I proposed a self-training framework aided by graph self-supervised pre-training, which enables joint learning from labeled and unlabeled rumor data and achieves significant performance improvements at low cost. This work was published in _Neurocomputing_ in 2024, titled “[A Debiased Self-Training Framework with Graph Self-Supervised Pre-training Aided for Semi-Supervised Rumor Detection](https://yuhan-qiao.github.io/mypaper/journal/neurocom.pdf).” This work also forms the core of my [master’s thesis](https://yuhan-qiao.github.io/mypaper/thesis/Master_thesis.pdf), which further explores the role of self-supervised pre-training in graph-based rumor detection.
